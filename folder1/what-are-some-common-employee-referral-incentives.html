They’re also fairly simple to set up and administer. And they don’t require a significant upfront investment. If you don’t have a formal employee referral program in place, now is the time to start one. An employee referral incentive program can help you find top talent faster and at a lower cost. A good employee referral program uses a combination of carrots (incentives) and sticks (consequences) to encourage current employees to actively seek out new talent. And it should be customized for your company’s specific needs and culture. Here are some examples of what you can do with your own program:</p><h2>Create an employee referral program website</h2><p>The first step in setting up a successful employee referral incentive program is to create a website that details all the details. You’ll want to include information about what the program is, why it exists, how it works, what the benefits are for both the company and the employee, and how to start the process of recruiting new talent.</p><h2>Set specific referral goals</h2><p>An employee referral program should have measurable goals. For example, if you want to increase the number of referrals you receive by 25%, you’ll want to set a specific goal for that. You’ll want to make sure that you’re measuring your progress against that goal. You can do this by tracking the number of referrals you receive and how many leads come from each source (such as word of mouth, online ads, etc.).</p><h2>Reward employees for successful referrals</h2><p>One of the best ways to encourage your employees to make more referrals is to reward them for successful ones. You can do this in a number of ways. You can give your employees a cash bonus for each successful referral. Or you can give them a percentage of the first year’s salary of the new hire. You can also give them extra vacation time.
